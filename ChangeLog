	* fixed Makefile.am to add scripts to distribution;
	* fixed xINCDIRx and xPERLx inside scripts 
	* fixed configure.ac to create scripts (replace .plib
          by .pl.in to produce .pl)

2006-03-01  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * surface_qc.pl: new file, for surface quality checks
        * cortical_thickness.pl: new file, for easy calculation
          of cortical thickness using tlink, tnear, tnormal,
          tlaplace
        * most scripts: allow 328K surfaces, add mincdefrag,
          more iterations and use linear weights for gray
          expansion, remove a white matter masking step that
          was chopping the left occipital lobe, etc.
        * evaluate_fit_3d.c (functions evaluate_laplacian_fit
          and evaluate_laplacian_fit_deriv): add oversampling,
          remove check on tissue type in derivative, clean-up
          calculation of derivative, print residual to measure
          convergence.

	* renamed new_fit_3D to surface_fit

	* delete some redundant code in 'evaluate_laplacian_fit' & 
        'evaluate_volume_fit'

	* scripts/Makefile.am:
	* scripts/asp.pl: Set MNI_DATAPATH, if not already in 
	environment.

	* scripts/mask_cortical_white_matter.pl: Substitute
